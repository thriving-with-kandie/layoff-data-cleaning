Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize global employee layoffs in the private sector from 2020 to 2023. Utilizing SQL for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization, the objective is to uncover trends and insights related to workforce reductions during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle's Layoffs Dataset. It encompasses information on layoffs across various industries, companies, and locations.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

Data Cleaning: Addressing duplicates, standardizing data formats, handling null values, and removing unnecessary columns to ensure data consistency and reliability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating the cleaned dataset to identify patterns and trends, such as:

Monthly distribution of layoffs
Industry-specific impacts
Geographical distribution of layoffs
Company-specific layoff statistics
Data Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards using Tableau to effectively communicate the findings and facilitate deeper insights.

Key Findings
Monthly Layoff Trends: January consistently experiences the highest number of layoffs annually, possibly due to corporate restructuring and new year planning.

Industry Impact: The technology sector has been significantly affected, with numerous companies implementing substantial workforce reductions.

Geographical Distribution: The United States leads in the number of layoffs, followed by countries like Sweden and the Netherlands.

Company-Specific Data: Certain companies have laid off a large percentage of their workforce, with some reaching 100% layoffs.

Tools and Technologies
SQL: Utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

Conclusion
This analysis offers valuable insights into global layoff trends during a critical period. The findings can assist policymakers, business leaders, and researchers in understanding the factors contributing to workforce reductions and in developing strategies to mitigate such events in the future.
